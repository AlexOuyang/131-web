CSE 131 is an introduction to modern Compiler Design.
According to the venerable [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)

> A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs)
> that transforms source code written in a programming
> language (the source language) into another computer
> language (the target language), with the latter often
> having a binary form known as object code.[1]
>  The most common reason for converting source code is
> to create an executable program.



In the course of the next ten weeks, we will look at
how to convert programs written in a high-level language
think ML from [CSE 130](http://ucsd-progsys.github.io/cse130/),
all the way down to bare metal, i.e. x86 assembly.
While doing so, we will *also* learn important lessons about
Software Engineering and Testing. As an added bonus, CSE 131
will reinforce and tie together concepts learnt in
Computer Organization and Programming Languages, in
particular showing the connections between assembly (x86),
systems (C) and functional (Haskell) programming.


## Integrity of Scholarship

University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By
taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on
Integrity of Scholarship described [here](http://www-senate.ucsd.edu/manual/Appendices/app2.htm).
In particular,

> all academic work will be done by the student to whom it is assigned,
> without unauthorized aid of any kind.

You are expected to do your own work on all assignments; when 
specified, you **may work in pairs** -- but will submit the 
assignments individually. You may (and are encouraged to) 
engage in **general discussions** with your classmates 
regarding the assignments, but specific details of a 
solution, including the solution itself, 
**must always be your own work**.

There will be graded assignments and exam in this course, 
as described below. All exams are closed book; no tools 
other than your brain and a writing instrument are to be used.

Incidents which violate the University's rules on integrity of scholarship
will be taken seriously.  In addition to **receiving a zero (0)** on the
assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties,
up to and including, expulsion from the University.  Should you have
any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity
regarding the course, please see the instructor.

## Research

Your class work might be used for research purposes. For example, we may
use anonymized student assignments to design algorithms or build tools to
help programmers. Any student who wishes to opt out can contact the
instructor or TA to do so after final grades have been issued. 
**This has no impact on your grade in any manner.**
